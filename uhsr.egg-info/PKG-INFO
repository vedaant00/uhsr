# Unified Hyperbolic Spectral Retrieval (UHSR)

Unified Hyperbolic Spectral Retrieval (UHSR) is a novel text retrieval algorithm that fuses lexical search (using BM25) with semantic search (using dense embeddings) into a unified, robust, and scalable system. It leverages advanced techniques such as logistic normalization, harmonic fusion, and spectral re-ranking based on graph Laplacian analysis to produce interpretable relevance scores within the [0,1] range.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines BM25 for lexical scoring and dense vector semantic similarity for contextual understanding.
- **Advanced Fusion:** Uses logistic normalization and harmonic fusion to integrate multiple scoring signals.
- **Spectral Re-Ranking:** Employs spectral analysis (using the graph Laplacian and Fiedler vector) to boost central, highly relevant candidates.
- **Metric Flexibility:** Supports multiple semantic similarity metrics (cosine, euclidean, Mahalanobis) to suit various datasets.
- **Interpretable Scores:** Final relevance scores are normalized to the [0,1] range.
- **Scalable:** Designed to work with both small and large datasets using FAISS for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.

## Overview

UHSR provides an end-to-end text retrieval pipeline that starts with raw documents and ends with a ranked list of documents. It first applies BM25 to perform fast lexical filtering, then computes semantic similarity using dense embeddings. The two scoring components are fused via a harmonic mean after logistic normalization, ensuring that both lexical and semantic aspects contribute effectively. Finally, a spectral re-ranking step based on graph Laplacian analysis refines the ranking by boosting documents that are centrally located among the top candidates.

## Intended Use

UHSR is intended for research and educational purposes and can serve as a strong foundation for further development in text retrieval and natural language processing applications.
